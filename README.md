# Breast Cancer Analysis 🩺🎗️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data and building machine learning models
to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

## 📊 Dataset
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
- Features include radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Scaling
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors

## 📈 Results
The models were evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
