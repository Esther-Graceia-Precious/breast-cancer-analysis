# Breast Cancer Analysis 

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data and building machine learning models
to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

##  Dataset
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
- Features include radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

##  Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Scaling
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation

##  Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors

##  Results
The models were evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/model.py
